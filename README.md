# Hello, Friend.

I'm PLXVST
Senior Pentester, Security Auditor, and Malware Analyst in the making.   

## Objective
To infiltrate and protect the systems that shape our digital world.  
My aim is to join and empower a red or blue teamâ€”where impact matters.  
The rules are written in packets, and I read between the lines.
